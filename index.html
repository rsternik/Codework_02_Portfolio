      <h2>GALACTIC BOUNTER HUNTER</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>The daughter of Rodney Aran and Virginia Aran, she lost her parents during a Space Pirate raid on her home of
        K-2L. Later, Samus was adopted by the mysterious Chozo and taken to Zebes, where she was infused with their DNA
        and raised to become a warrior.<br><br> Once she reached adulthood, Samus joined the Federation Police and
        served under
        the Commanding Officer Adam Malkovich. Though she ultimately left to become a Bounty Hunter, she was nonetheless
        hired by the Galactic Federation on many occasions. <br><br>Equipped with her cybernetic Power Suit, Samus has
        become
        famous for accomplishing missions previously thought impossible. <br><br>Her most renowned achievements are the
        destruction of the Space Pirate base on Zebes, her role in ending the Galactic Phazon crisis, her extermination
        of the Metroid species, and her disobedience of orders at the Biologic Space Laboratories research station where
        she chose to destroy the deadly X Parasites rather than turn them over to the Galactic Federation.</p>

      <h3>MISSION HISTORY</h3>
      <p class="work1">
        The Galactic Federation takes the incident with the Space Pirates on planet Zebes very seriously.
        They send a research ship to planet SR388 to confirm the existence of the Metroid there. However, the ship
        disappears.
        <br><br>
        A rescue unit is sent to SR388, but contact is lost with them as well. The Federation concludes that the
        subterranean Metroid creatures are responsible. Samus is called in once again, this time to exterminate the
        Metroid threat on SR388.
        <br><br>
        After many deadly battles with the Metroid in their various evolutionary forms, Samus confronts and defeats the
        Queen Metroid, marking a successful end to the mission. Unexpectedly, a newborn Metroid hatches in front of
        Samus—as she is the first creature it sees, the larva imprints on Samus and believes her to be its mother. Samus
        can’t bring herself to kill the hatchling, so she takes it back to the Galactic Federation’s Space Science
        Academy for study.
      </p>

      <p class="work2">

        <br><br>
        Samus is hired by biotech company Biologic Space Laboratories (B.S.L.) to protect a field research unit on
        planet SR388.
        <br><br>
        Research on the surface goes well until Samus is exposed to and attacked by the X parasite, a lifeform with the
        ability to mimic organic creatures in their entirety. The parasite puts Samus in critical condition and renders
        her unconscious. All hope seems lost as the X quickly multiplies and erodes her body.
        <br><br>
        Scientists determine that a vaccine made using a cell culture sourced from the Metroid hatchling is Samus’ only
        chance of survival. She miraculously escapes death, and, at the same time, becomes the only living creature with
        immunity to the X parasite.
        <br><br>
        Aboard the B.S.L. station orbiting SR388, Samus engages in a fierce battle with the SA-X—a mimic of Samus in her
        Power Suit at full strength—and succeeds in wiping out the X parasite, destroying the station and planet SR388
        in the process.
