      <h2>Who is Samus Aran?</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>The daughter of Rodney Aran and Virginia Aran, she lost her parents during a Space Pirate raid on her home of
        K-2L. Later, Samus was adopted by the mysterious Chozo and taken to Zebes, where she was infused with their DNA
        and raised to become a warrior.<br><br> Once she reached adulthood, Samus joined the Federation Police and served under
        the Commanding Officer Adam Malkovich. Though she ultimately left to become a Bounty Hunter, she was nonetheless
        hired by the Galactic Federation on many occasions. <br><br>Equipped with her cybernetic Power Suit, Samus has become
        famous for accomplishing missions previously thought impossible. <br><br>Her most renowned achievements are the
        destruction of the Space Pirate base on Zebes, her role in ending the Galactic Phazon crisis, her extermination
        of the Metroid species, and her disobedience of orders at the Biologic Space Laboratories research station where
        she chose to destroy the deadly X Parasites rather than turn them over to the Galactic Federation.</p>
